newsweek persp registered the cargo plane by raymond loos angelesthe decision of donald nelson to authorize henry j kaiser to build three giant cargo planes in collaboration with howard hughes seems to make a good deal of sense the interest aroused by this news and by the long and informative discussions that preceded it has done a great deal to make people appreciate the value of large cargoflying ships the experi mental work now authorized will teach us all much that will be useful in the war effort and in transportation after the war it is obvious that when an entirely new design is contemplated it takes time to produce even experimental models it is estimated by mr kaiser and mr hughes that the three will not months the second in months and the third in months if it is then decided to put them into production some months must elapse before they roll off the line the public has been informed from time to time of quite understandable differences of opinion about the feasi bility and desirability of building this type of plane at this time one of the reasons for misunderstanding has been the fact that ideas as well as specific plans have been continually changing throughout the period of discussion at all times many complicated technical problems of management and engineer ing have been involved after wide discussion in washington and elsewhere a meeting was held here about four weeks ago between mr a wpb representative and a committee of three leaders in the air plane industry this committee was acting upon a suggestion of the wpb to talk the matter over with mr kaiser and to report on their findings and con clusions no specific plan came out of the meeting this was not because the industry itself was lacking in a desire to cooperate it is the settled rule in the industry that any manufacturer will make available any plans engineering ideas advice and technical personnel at his disposal to any other manufacturer who actually has an order from the government to build planes at that time mr kaiser had no such order and there was a good deal of uncertainty as to the plane that was to be built and ro be finished for two yearsthe first in kaiser september ective s patent office question the organization which was to do the building in these circumstances it was urged that mr kaiser give his unquestioned manufacturing ability to the mass pro duction of some model already designed but it seems that mr kaiser thought it best to build a new plane leaders of the industry pointed out the great outlay of time and the requirements of moley and labor needed for the development of an entirely new model it is said that in the automobile industry a new model takes close to three years from the original idea to mass production some thing of the same effort is required in the case of a new plane to undertake critical materials engineering personnel mass production of a new plane would draw heavily upon the strained re sources of an already overburdened in dustry this apparently became clear not only to the industry but to the various authorities in the government there is no disposition to deny that vastly bigger planes can be built than any that now exist or to deny that they will fly and thatthey will carry a lot of stuff when a certain manufacturer was asked how big a cargo plane could be built his answer was just tell me how much land or water is available to take off from or to land in such ques tions as this as well as the number and type of cargo planes that will be needed are matters of strategy to be decided by the army and the navy there is no reason now to assume that this war will have to be fought with the exact types of plane already in production but it does seem likely that whatever is new or startling in the planes that will come off the production line for some time to come will be a modification and improvement of basic designs that now exist leaders in the industry here and elsewhere have been stressing the im portance of carriers for a long time and point to the number of excellent cargo planes already in production the cam paign of mr kaiser has heavily under scored their importance he can have the immense satisfaction of knowing that he has directed the nations atten tion to the value of large carriers everyone will wish him well in his new project newsweek perspective u s three governorships by raymond as we come to midoctober two political conclusions are clear one is a drift toward republican candidates the other is a prospective small vote these two signs may or may not have something in common my impression is that they are not related the small vote will come from many contributing causes first a lot of people are in the army and navy second a lot more are too busy to think about politics an election is a sort of little war and many vote merely to participate in a contest now a real war captures the spirit of contention in people a great many people have moved because of their employment and while a lot of these still have the technical qualifications for voting they are in strange surroundings and the normal political pressures on them are gone many thousands have moved from rural districts to cities and know little of urban registrationrules these perfectly clear causes with a number of additional ones will account for a light vote it is unnecessary to characterize it as apathy the republican drift is unmistakable see periscope preview vast numbers of peopleare dissatisfied with the con duct of the war at home and abroad the rubber debacle alone will lose the administration countless votes the presidents scolding of farmers has made no new city and labor votes but has lost him thousands in agri cultural regions the new deal has

his manager farley is stronger in upstate republican new york than any candidate in years but weaker in the big city as things look now dewey may come close to the un precedented feat of carrying the city as a republican this creates an em barrassment of sorts for both dewey and bennett dewey cannot attack the roosevelt administration vigorously for fear of losing the city bennett cannot october

announcement within a month or so when edward j flynn the present democratic chairman is expected to resign with the restoration of a close balance in party strength the choice of a new chairman in each case is not unim portant in fact it may provide some clue to the political events of in the democratic party the presi dent will dictate the decision his problem will be only to make a selection from the rather scanty list of possibili ties but these facts are of themselves meaningful symptoms of the party organizations state of health it can hardly be said that there are any active

many a day before another farley is found the bloom is simply off the job not much patronage remains to be given out and the new deal inner circle provides what political counsel the president needs the fight for the chairmanship in the republican party on the other hand suggests the vigor of the partys hopes so does the fact that so many prospective presidential candidacies are in evidence the

wellknown businessman are ex ceedingly slim after an insistent demand by mr willkie a statement on foreign affairs was adopted at the april meeting of the republican national committee this time there is little demand for statements of party policy that is fortunate because the making of any resolution on national policy by the national committee is an impropriety it has no legal power to bind the party the convention does that the com mittees job is to keep the national party alive between presidential cam paigns to prepare for the convention and the campaign to raise money to conduct research on national affairs and to maintain contact with state and local organizations mr willkies influence in the forth coming meeting will be of some im portance but it will not be decisive the candidate will it is said con trol not over a quarter of the members the rift between him and the party organization is now pretty deep but arguments among republicans while troublesome are not signs of weakness in the republican party emerged from years of internal conflict to win the election in though the preconvention fight of the democrats was bitter they carried through tri umphantly the real test of the re publican party will be the performance of its governors it members of the house and its senators not what its members say about each other perspective us registered patent light on an old by raymond moley n wuhart history may call the great stassen gaffe the principal therein proposed to ignore the preferences of a great majority of republican leaders and to present a ticket to please some people in the republican party in labor minorities and independents and the independent people at home important portions of the popu lation abroad and the uncommitted nations in the world only somewhat less befuddled are those who have been telling us for some years that republicans should ignore their own party membership and prepare ticket and program to convert demo crats and to cozen independents this conversion ee popular these or perhaps reconversion on the other hand true masters of politics design political activityall the printing and oratory all the piety and witto inspire party members with confidence and to stir the sympathetic but lazy to get out and vote strategyvery days with people who while paying lip service to the president would at tack the republican partyassumes that there is a fixed number of demo crats and republicans with a decisive minority of socalled independents the conclusion that they would have us draw is that the only way a candi date on the republican ticket can win is to look so much and talk so much like a liberal democrat that voters will switch sides and elect him this concept i have called the myth of a static electorate the fallacy behind it is the idea that political action is concerned with independents scorned the late ed flynn of the bronx up to the end fdrs most intimate po litical mentor told me back in the s that his strategy and mr roosevelts was to assume the loyalty of democrats who had voted for the party before and to aim at peo ple who had not been voting but who were radical in outlook flynn and mr roosevelt scoffed at the idea of converting republicans they were people to attack not flatter flynn scorned the idea of independents i studied two british elections at firsthand in and and talked with many professional workers in both parties in england scotland fraud a office and wales the lasting lesson learned was that those realists paid little attention to opposition voters they used their resources to get out every sympathizer and many needed plenty of prodding the contest was a matter of efficiency and since there were twice as many professional con servative agents the victory went to that party it was left to the theorists in london and oxford to believe that speeches were decisive independ ents over there are contemptuously known as floaters so far as i know billy graham is not trying to turn catholics and jews into methodists and baptists but to get at the unaffiliated he is much too wise to call the unwashed and un saved independent market for votes in stevenson received about million votes which is roughly the sum of trumans million wallaces and thurmonds million each and a million more new voters in old democratic families mr eisenhower received deweys mil lion plus some millions who had been conservatively inclined but in different in plus a number of new voters except in the south there were few conversions while the vote was large there were and are somewhere around million eligibles who failed to vote that is the market for votes where either party may find a major ity those nonvoting eligibles are not independent they are merely inac tive republicans may confidently assume that more that half of them are inclined to conservatism the people who are talking about a static electorate also say that since democratic candidates for the house received in more votes than re oublican candidates the republican party is a permanent minority they fail to add that there were districts in which there were no contests and that of them were democratic in all contested districts republican can didates were votes ahead except in describing a single elec tion it is absurd to talk about minority or majority parties the size of a partys vote is whatever zeal and hard work can make it newsweek august perspective registered us patent a matter of loyalty by raymond os angelesin his chicago accept le ance speech adlai stevenson said the truth is that president eisenhower cynically coveted as a candidate but ignored as a leader is largely indebted to democrats in congress for what accomplishments he can claim the truth is in direct contradiction to this grave charge of disloyalty to the president against the republican party in congress indeed the candidate own charge by asserting in the loose fancyfree rhetoric which belies his in sixteen repetitions of the word leadership that the president is no leader we are therefore invited to believe that the democrats in congress have been following a ghostly nimbus also stevenson implies that he approves of the presidents program but selfcontradictions are common is the pleasant adornment of capri cious disorderly thinking let us ap peal to the facts the candidate made this charge of disloyalty on july citing as au thority the congressional quarterly i challenged that private information service in this space under date of july and my piece has been in serted in the congressional record with corroborative materials from sen ators schoeppel margaret chase smith and others moley rollcall analysis the respective chairmen of the re publican senate and congressional campaign committees have inserted in the congressional record of aug and aug a complete analysis of all roll calls in both the rd and th congresses this represents a monumental job of research which can be checked and audited for accuracy this analysis shows that after elim inating from the total roll calls in the two congresses items which were merely procedural and organizational and also others which were not in the presidents program there were with which we are evaluating republican concerned in loyalty to the president a on these majority of republicans in both houses in both congresses opposed the president in per cent of the cases a majority of democrats opposed the president in per cent of those cases office the analysis also shows that in all eisenhower issues in both houses the republicans supplied per cent of all votes cast for the program and the democrats per cent of those votes putting it another way the record shows that the democrats supplied per cent of all opposition votes and the republicans only per cent there were house and senate roll callsor per cent of the eisenhower roll callson which a ma jority of both parties were not united behind president eisenhowers pro gram these include the per cent of the roll calls in which a majority of republicans were opposed to the presidents program yet even after in cluding those the republicans sup plied per cent of all the favorable votes on those roll calls and the democrats only per cent of the opposition votes the democrats sup plied per cent and the republi cans per cent nature of issues moreover in the detailed informa tion offered in the study concerning the nature of the issues in which some democratic votes were necessary to win for the president a very considerable proportion involved the eisenhowerbenson agricultural poli cies and a conflicting farm program of the democrats others had to do with spending items in which the president had the support of economyminded democrats it comes with poor grace for the candidate of a party dedi cated to overturning the eisenhower benson farm program and to more spending to claim credit for these an examination of those roll calls in which a majority of republicans supported and a majority of demo crats opposed the president shows that the president won in per cent of the cases in the republican rd congress and in only per cent of the cases in the democratic th con gress that forcefully illustrates why the president is asking for a republi can congress at this record of loyalty is certainly bright in contrast with the troubled

washington and idaho the administration may scuttle its partnership policy and favor heavy spending for federal projects in those states interior secretary seaton has since asserted that there is no reason to inflict the whole burden of financ ing those projects on the federal government whenever and wherever nonfederal interests are willing to assume a share this will be a major test for a presi

the states immediately concerned there is no valid reason in morals or national policy why the odd other states of the union should be taxed for the northwest when there is avail able plenty of private investors capital to bear a share industry will be the lure of subsidized federal power vast sums have already been spent by the federal government in the columbia basin approximately per cent of the money spent by congress for hydroelectric projects in the past ten years has gone to the northwest it has averaged million a year twice that amount annually will be needed to provide an adequate sup ply of power in that region it is simply not possible to expect congress to grant any such sums to a few states because indoctrinated and mobilized on elec drawn from the east and midwest by what has really happened has been the penetration and invigoration of the democratic party in both oregon and washington by the political ma chines of labor unions there was also the introduction into the idaho cam paign of eastern money to defeat senator welker in oregon there were large sums of laborunion money plus workers from outside the state to reelect morse in washington the thousands of workers in and around hanford and in seattle and tacoma were thoroughly organized politically oregon washington and idaho combined pay less than per cent of federal income taxes the complaint of the generality of the nations taxpayers gains additional strength when it is noted that unlike the impoverished s when bonne ville and grand coulee were built there is adequate money now avail able

send a man out there when we have such wonderful instruments he answered only a man can find what we are not looking for an instrument can find only what we think is there this sentence of his throws a great light on a conflict in ideas that has been raging for the century since marx and darwin there were those who believed that the seminal writings of these men unlocked an entirely new door to an interpretation of man and his place in the world their interpretation of science reformers in history politics and nature was that man is a mere item in the mass of natural forces in the material world and uni verse his personality they held was a composite of inherited instincts and of environmental influences he had no free will and was without per sonal responsibility in history the application of this determinism was socalled economic interpretation the american revo lution thus became a squabble over taxes the constitution was made by men who sought protection for their securities and land the two parties were mere congregations of debtors on one side and creditors on the other in jurisprudence the ancient con cept of the reign of law was re jected justice should be applied in accordance with what the judge be lieved to be justified by sociology and psychology in court the mans en vironment was judged not the culprit destiny in politics where determinism did its crowning mischief a candidate or party merely added up the specific material yearnings of each of a group of minorities and made a total ma jority miscalled the general welfare elections thus became auctions of items of interest only to mens stom achs and purses notable even great men taught determinism as a tool to move human behavior but what they properly con ceived to be a hint concerning human behavior their lesser followers seized upon as a complete answer a tool became a key the sorcerers appren us patent raymond office evil end moley tices knew how to turn on the water but not how

maelstrom of world events in which we find ourselves and the actual phys ical business of campaigning distin guish this toplevel debate from all others in the past after visiting a considerable num ber of states from coast to coast and changes the air train rest reasonable that ever was days collect timate bruised mon after examining the communications i have received from those reporters who have visited other states it is my conclusion that upheavals and flaring conflicts in asia africa and latin america are haunting american minds far more than the fate of the farmer the family budget of the worker con cern about possible catastrophic ill ness or housing or school classrooms these latter are important matters but when there is the possible col lapse of the un and maybe a spread of war which would engulf millions and cast death over the land for ci vilians as well as the military there is priority among apprehensions party lines ignored more americans than some of us realize

may mean peace or war annihilation or secu raincoat and port to lem speeches shakes of mental ical human may words deep rity thus there is developing a dif ferentiation in the estimates of voters between district and state candidates and the two individuals who are run ning for president i could name spe cifically half a dozen states in which it is more than likely that the majority will go to one party in the state elec tion and to the national candidates of the other party voters are likely to ignore party lines in evaluating the names on the national tickets moreover the sheer physical

it based upon an article by a responsi ble reporter der linden by senators kennedy clements douglas lehman pastore murray and mcnamara which proposed ex actly what the platform promises about righttowork laws kennedy answered that he did not press its passage kennedy could have done so because he was a member of the labor committee and could have in sisted upon hearings there were no such hearings and the bill died kennedy s frank van published in southern newspapers in cluding the nashville banner and the greenville sc news the ac count did not come from byrd but apparently from the johnson people in late august kennedy and johnson had a meeting of southern senators to win their support for the national ticket byrd was a conspicu ous absentee thereupon kennedy and johnson asked to come to byrds office to explain things byrd told the two candidates that he disagreed with most of the los angeles plat form especially the pledge to repeal that section of the tafthartley act which permitted states to enact righttowork laws byrd was as sured by kennedy and johnson that such a repeal wont necessarily be enacted if they are elected byrd then confronted kennedy with a bill s introduced to meany byrd made it clear then as he did in the senate in a speech that he considered such a repeal an unwar ranted invasion of the right of a state to enact such a law twenty states have it and in nine righttowork is in the state constitution because a vote of the people in the aflcio news for oct there appears a lengthy in terview of kennedy by president george meany mr meany senator

that goal preserve and pro tect the legitimate rights of legitimate unions now means the elimination of some antilabor sections of the present labor laws to that end i am un equivocally committed nixon opposes the repeal of that section of tafthartley facing both ways while the great majority of the leaders of the big unions are com mitted to the kennedyjohnson ticket the millions of members who have elected them and supported them with their dues should consider se riously the foregoing accounts of what kennedy and johnson have saidin one case to the south and in the other to the unions through their offi cial publication the wisdom and effectiveness of righttowork laws is not the issue here the issue goes to the validity of a party platform and the pledges of party candidates that is a matter for union members to consider it also goes to the constitutional right of a state to legislate on a sub ject which concerns its internal af fairs if the federal government can invade a right of a state validated by the courts to pass these laws and twenty states have exercised that rightthere will remain little in a states province that cannot be taken away by a triumphant powerful ma jority in congress backed by a presi dent who believes in such invasions that is a matter for citizens of the south indeed for all americans to consider this goes to the essence of the kind of government we shall have in the united states it is well known that the southern states are bitterly opposed to most of the provisions of the los angeles platform texas democrats made that position official in their state platform johnson said recently on meet the press that he had not calculated what either platform would cost thus he has endorsed a platform which to him has no meaning in terms of money or taxes newsweek october perspective the a a to a n the midst of all the handon heart declarations of politicians concerning the negroes who are pre vented from voting and the boasts that the right to vote has been ex tended by federal law to enfranchise those people to my knowledge noth ing has been said or done by either party for million voters who were unable to vote on nov these are american citizens who have moved from state to state this number would be enough to swing the presi dential balance in a number of states in a close election in newsweeks own organization i know a consider able number of executive sales and editorial personnel who lost their votes because of being shifted from state to state as we turn to much larger business enterprises the numbers run very high great corporations engaged in man ufacturing or oil production and dis tribution or chain stores must of necessity shift managers salesmen and other executives constantly each such shift made within a year dis franchises in must cases at least two votes and in some cases more there is no rational reason why these people should not be permitted to vote for president and vice president the bar to voting in of the states is the requirement of one years resi dence for eligibility three states re quire two years others require six months perhaps reasons may be of fered why relative strangers in a com munity or state should not participate in electing state and local officials since their familiarity with local con ditions may be inadequate to justify a voice in such choices but that does not apply to the election of the presi dent and vice president who are na tionally known and who must serve all the people in all the states correction by law this injustice could of course be corrected by legislation in the states according to the american heritage it foundation a nonpartisan organiza tion which has done a splendid job in getting out the vote for several years three states have made such changes in their voting requirements cali fornia has fixed the residence re quirement at days missouri at disfranchised by raymond should not apply to voting for mem bers of the senate and house of rep resentatives because under our system these are selected not only to make laws to apply to all but to rep resent in congress the interests of their states moley days and ohio at days but such changes in state laws take a long time voting qualifications are embedded in many state constitutions it seems to me that federal legisla tion might be held constitutional which would permit every qualified american citizen to cast a vote fo president and vice president where he has lived for days i have not studied the cases on this but i invite lawyers and election officials who may read this to write and give me their opinions perhaps such liberalization twoday elections according to the american herit age foundations statement three other groups were disfranchised for no substantial reason there were million who were business travelers or sick and hospitalized who lost their votes because of the variations of re quirements among the states for sentee ballots there are also the disfranchised in the district of columbia barring the latter rests upon reasons which have long since lost any rational meaning eight hundred thousand illiterates are barred which is proper despite the radical proposal of the demoesatil platform to abolish all literacy tests there are millions more who areh barred because of moving about within states and who do not under stand the complicated process of new registration changes of registration take time and knowledge another suggestion would be to provide two days for elections this is allowed in some european countries when we are selecting people to serve us for two or four years two days for voting would not be too long for making the momentous choices the low percentage of voting among those who are eligible has been and remains a blot on our national con science but that low percentage could be raised by areconsidera tion and simplification of our absur and obsolete electoral system newsweek november perspective is

with only the sad satisfaction that at any rate my small effort had helped to unite the christian churches on least this one subject never have so many letters come in about an article until now this time they are all in response to what i wrote in this space three weeks ago about the millions who were pre vented from voting because of resi dence requirements in this instance all the letters were in accord some letters were from people who were themselves the victims of absurd and outworn residence requirements others dealt with the difficulty of get ting and casting absentee ballots some were from state and local offi cials suggesting reforms and since had invited legal opinions about fed eral legislation dealing with the sub ject several were from lawyers hope that this present article will bring many more nobly conceived red or mess the denial of the right to vote is subject which governors should deal with in their annual messages and which legislators should consider the new year there can be only one conclusion from the abundant evi dence on hand democracy is a nobly conceived experiment but in its op eration in the united states it is mess while there are millions of peo ple who are too careless and apathetic and selfish to care about voting there are millions of others who want vote and cannot it now appears not only that many have been disfranchised because clumsy laws and customs but that indeterminate number who legiti mately voted were not counted the final returnsenough perhaps have reversed the final choice of president no doubt thousands other votes were

the presidents veto would have taken the rural electrification administration away from the watchful eye of a fine public servant secretary benson the washington lobby for rural electrification many members of congress and zealots for a government power monopoly want to push rural electrification beyond the remote farmers who are now supplied to the suburbs and the cities this would be deadly competition with investorowned companies because the government is lending money to the rural electrical cooperatives at per centhalf or less what the government must pay for it spectacular growth no one questions the validity of the original purpose of the rea nor the wholesome character of most of the cooperatives most of them are content with sticking to their field with modest returns but since they are associated in a sort of trade associationpressure lobby called the national rural electric cooperative association they are being led collectively into a vast scheme which promises illimitable profits not in the production and sale of electricity but in banking and investment that is so long as the present per cent rate of borrowing from the government and taxfree status can be retained the head of the nreca clyde c ellis is a man of vast imagination coupled with incredible political influence at the last meeting of his organization he unfolded the plan it involves the brimming financial position of the cooperatives the latest reports show a spectacular growth in their investments and savings account in this was million in it was million the total earned surplus rose from million in to million in ellis proposed that the investment account be put into his nreca in trusteeshipan unusual function for a trade associationpressure organization then he proposed that this pool be placed with a new york bank for investment opportunities it is ironical that ellis has always denounced the wall street financing of the private investorowned companies bluechip pool a pool he said would be able to invest a reasonable portion of its funds quite soundly in the highest grade blue chip industrial bonds and most of the balance in the highestyield longterm governments the pool would have a constant inflow from maturing investments and from new investments and therefore would have to keep on hand only a relatively small amount of shortterm lowyield governments this fact alone could appreciably increase the return over that of a single systems program with the same flexibility it would indeed if the cooperatives choose to relinquish their independence and give over to this sort of vast investment operation made profitable by borrowing from the government at half or less than half the price which government must pay for its money for this pool might become the biggest thing in wall street space permits only a mention of another ellis dream recently proposed it would have the federal government build a big potomac river project on the tva model it would

high taxes and hard work by raymond moley there are still oldfashioned folks among us who believe that high taxes discourage hard work extra effort more production and hence more income and more taxes to pay they agree with the tramp in the cartoon who said i finally found a way to beat the income tax and i havent worked since but there is a school of modern economists well represented in the harvard graduate school of business administration who are undermining this last remaining tenet of more primitive times these economists hold that the exact opposite is true prof sumner h slichter who has his moments of empyrean flight puts forth the new thought this way high taxes on profits may even be stimulating rather than discouraging to business no one objects to people speculating on such things in harvardas long as they stay in harvard when they become policymakers in the government of the united states however their ideas become a matter of public concern in this case of great concern slichters generality seems to have been based upon a curious book the effects of taxation on executives by thomas h sanders also a harvard business school professor it was edited by dan throop smith a professor on leave who when appointed to serve with under secretary marion b folsom was announced as responsible for analysis and building of tax policy can it be that the administrations insistence upon a continuation of the iniquitous excessprofits levy was based at least in part upon the theories of smith who still believes the sanders book to be sound prof david mccord wright in an address published by the national industrial conference board neatly dissects the book he points out that the conclusions of the author are merely a writeup heavily edited of a somewhat haphazard collection of interviews professor wright also points out that even the interviews presented by sanders contain a good deal of evidence that high taxes are a deterrent on business enterprise in a passage where sanders discusses the comments made by selfmade executives about their sons he says that said sons are not occupied with work progress in business but with the good life good living and forms of social service wright observes that he is surprised that a business school of all institutions should release a book in which the good life is in some way opposed to work of course harvard will claim that sanders opinions are in the realm of academic freedom that might mean that people who do not believe in success should teach young men how to succeed i would add to wrights criticism two further observations the first is that this school of economists seem to have revived a myth which they of all people have always labored to dissipatethe economic man they have created a new economic manthis time the businessman and have tried to put an abstraction into material form who knows what predominates in the mass of impulses that drives him to scorn delights and live laborious days and who can devise a generality that fits such a conglomerate of people my other observation is that once more we see an effort to use taxation to produce something other than revenue new deal economists used taxes for all sorts of thingsfor reforming people generally for redistributing wealth for abolishing poverty for breaking up big business and even for hunting down criminals now comes a new use it is to make men work material profit may not be the sole motive that moves us but the earned dollar is still a measure of the value that others put upon our efforts and as such it is a measure of personal achievement and personal satisfaction progressive taxation notably in taxes on business is designed to put the heaviest penalty on that last extra effort that marks the difference between mediocrity and excellence surely that is not the way to promote national progress and high endeavor government was not designed to determine what makes men work newsweek september heres a text version of the provided image note that due to the image quality and column layout some minor inaccuracies might be present this is the best approximation possible given the input perspective excessive abuse by raymond moley addressing himself to the disgraceful exhibition of bias and bad manners by some of the correspondents at the presidents armistice day press conference richard wilson of the cowles publications said there was an excessive abuse of the privilege of the press by newspapermen who ought to know better it took courage for wilson to say this but he has courage as well as an unusual sense of the responsibilities of his profession but the armistice day exhibition and the outburst of criticism that it brought to the correspondents seem to have taught them nothing for the reporting of the presidents press conference on nov was in many papers a clear misstatement of what mr eisenhower said it was widely reported that the president indicated that he did not want the communist issue to be a major factor in the campaign this was easily interpreted to mean that he was opposed to an earlier statement of national chairman hall that the communist issue would really be a major factor this follows a line very clearly marked out by partisan democrats and intended to drive a wedge between the president and the republican national committee the presidents statements were also stretched by some correspondents and commentators to mean that he is inimical to congressional probes of communism in government let us see what the president said this is the salient part of the report of the press conference in which the president is replying to a question which quoted chairman hall and went on to ask the presidents opinion concerning the communist issue in issues in political campaigns are not made by any individual and that includes the president of the united states issues are made as he sees it by the needs of the country we know that the cleaning out in government of course is important he is proceeding with his associates the president said as strongly and as earnestly and as thoroughly as he can in that direction and he is trying to do it without doing injustice to any individual now he added he hopes that this whole thing will be a matter of history by the time the next election comes around that is a correct statement of the basic fact that issues are made by the interests and concerns of the public it is also a clear statement of confidence in his attorney general later chairman hall said i am in complete agreement with the president but i dont think that the people will quickly forget that the communists entered the government under the previous administrations and that they have been ousted and removed by the eisenhower administration to paraphrase hall candidates are going to ask the voters to remember who it was who put the communists in government and who drove them out the latter will include not only the president and attorney general but committees of congress which pursued subversion despite fierce criticism and respective chairmen of those committees one of the most blatant examples of bias in the armistice day conference was provided by anthony leviero of the new york times who said mr president i think this case is at best a pretty squalid one the rest of his long speechquestion was equally loaded with prejudice but a week later the times permitted him to conduct a pellmell poll of reporters on the question whether the eisenhower administration had embraced mccarthyism and to write a prejudiced story about it in a prominent place in the paper the problem of press behavior therefore moves beyond the individual reporter to the paper itself considering the way things are going the president should adopt one of two courses either abolish the presidential press conference or put it on television the public is entitled to know exactly what the president says and the tones and emphasis with which he speaks the proof is mounting that a considerable number of washington correspondents are unwilling to provide a definitive interpretation of what the president says newsweek

structure perspective mr k farm expert by raymond moley it must not be forgotten that khrushchev rose to power as a sort of agricultural genius not even the mystical henry wallace has had such wonderful farm plans as the jolly slav but unlike our henry mr k had direct methods of demonstrating his talents henry had statistics at his command and some authority but he was always hampered by his naïve ideas which he designated as democratic mr k permitted no such impediments furthermore he created his own statistical successes he originated in a ukrainian village and has posed as an agrarian expert a man close to the people who toil on collective farms it was mr k who a few years ago opened vast tracts east of the urals for progressive agriculture it was a foolhardy venture and there was plenty of headshaking among the hardhanded practical people who knew well the hostile arid wastes of kazakhstan but a plans a plan in the soviet regardless of the lord nature and experience and so men tractors and then women were shipped into the semidesert while henry wallace was a deeply religious man with mystical overtones and mr k certainly is not apparently the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike this time heavily in favor of the latter the rain came a mild temperature prevailed and the stuff grew mr k was photographed smiling over a large potato soviet juggling act statistics dont lie they say but it depends upon what you are counting and when facts can be manipulated to suit a purpose in mr ks rise after stalins death he made a sensational announcement soviet russia has fewer cattle than there were in czarist russia specialists pondered this astonishing assertion they found that mr k had classified cows as pigs and statistically transformed horned cattle into mares thus at the beginning of his enterprise he could point with alarm after three years statistical pigs were reincarnated as cows and the mares resumed their bovine classification the khrushchev propaganda duly capitalized upon this miracle wallace had a host of statisticians and knew in his off hours various haruspices if he had succeeded as he is doing now with chickens in cross breeding the two species his farm plans might have been the wonder of the ages that miracle belongs to the atheist mr k americans are familiar with the soviet boast whatever you do we can do better an american army officer in tokyo whose thumb was double jointed illustrated to a russian officer how he could bend his thumb back to his forearm the russian did it and was immediately consigned to the

says that tax cuts scheduled for april must be suspended because once more the budget cannot be balanced chronic extravagance which seems to be the order of the day seems to be due to the inability of the president to resist people who advise new forms of spending and to the fact that the heads of his big departments are the prisoners of the holdover bureaucracy but while the president needs backbone to achieve economy congress needs the means necessary to con trol its appropriations such means it was once thought would be available to both the president and congress through the budget and accounting act of under that act the twin offices of budget director and comptroller general were established the first was to serve the president the sec ond to inform congress both were designed to provide control over the federal establishment which even then was beginning to burst its seams both offices however have fallen victims of the disease they were supposed to attack bureauitis the budget director doesnt direct and the comptroller doesnt control this failure to realize the hopes of is especially notable in the case of the comptroller general six years ago in this space i pointed out that no other appointed officer outside the judiciary enjoys such a guarantee of independence the comptroller general is appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate for a term of fifteen years by this means it was intended to place him beyond the reach or influence of succeeding presi dents and congresses removal can be achieved only by impeachment or by joint resolution of congress for specified causes under the law the comptroller general can formulate policies which affect the interests of congress and measurably enforce them on execu tive departments the general terms of his power are sweeping he can settle all claims in which the united states is interested either as debtor or creditor and such settlement is final and conclusive upon the executive branch of the government most im portant of all he can on his own initia tive and without direction of congress investigate all matters relating to the receipt disbursement and application of public funds in conducting investi gations he can command all depart ments to furnish information and to give access to all records upon request the comptroller general exercises his power without direction from any other officer but unfortunately after granting this officer all this power congress by law and the comptroller general by practice moved into the field of government ac counting as a result ac counting which should be a function of the executive has bogged down and submerged the functions of audit and investigation in short congress failed to distin guish between audit and control an audit is an investigation and report on the fidelity and legality of completed transactions control on the other hand is the power to pass on expenditures and to prevent their being made and now for this immensely im portant office the president has sent to the senate for confirmation the name of joseph campbell who served for a while as treasurer of columbia university during the eisenhower presidency there he has since been a member of the aec he is an estimable gentleman and no doubt a good accountant but this job needs a strong investigator who can reso lutely set his face against not only irregularity but waste of every kind he should be the right arm of the ap propriations committees of congress in the years since the hoover commission reported before there has been a slight indication of in creased activity by the comptroller generals office it claims to have saved the government million this is good but in the words once used by bernard baruch only a faltering step

raymond moley londonthe monumental sweep of the conservatives in the british general election offers many force ful lessons for american political par ties for our politically active labor unions and for americans generally the plain facts revealed can scarcely be argued americans should aban don many of their political phantoms and fallacies the liberal wing of the democratic party should note the great similarity between its arguments and the now discredited appeals of the british so cialists both promise greater spend ing for social services housing and educational novelties both would find new taxes from the rich and from business both offer the keynesian theory of multiplying production by government spending in this gaitskell and most american liberal politicians and economists offer the same false elixir the british socialists and american liberals are simply of fering the antiquated concepts of the s the british electorate weary of these ideas rejected them and their sponsors local organization the political labor unions in amer ica and the british socialists alike en courage a class divisionthe rich and big business against the poor this class appeal utterly failed in this elec tion the great and growing middle group who are a majority in both countries want no class struggle both british and american workers are coming to scorn the idea that they are a class apart republicans and conservative dem ocrats should stop trying to outprom ise liberal democrats this only produces apathy which keeps their potential voters at home on election day we should have learned that in the british conservatives waste no time trying to argue with committed socialists they get their own potential voters to vote the conservatives fought hard and hit hard a soft appeal tranquilizes there must be a definable choice hard hitting produces excitement and a big vote and it was proved here that a big vote is a solidly conserva tive not a radical vote most important is the need of re publicans and conservative democrats for strong active local organization in britain much of the power that has brought victory in three elections and a great gain in four has come from the efficient party organization built up by lord woolton and churchill more than ten years ago after a great de feat its high efficiency has been kept up since it is based on the fact that elections are won in many local areas not on a mythical national level the big factor in conservative organiza tion is the agent who is profes sionally trained over a period of a year or eighteen months and who works the year around work of agents realizing the importance of the lo cal areas from my experience in cov ering the elections of and i neglected london this time and spent the last week in the birming ham area which comprises constit uencies the party machinery centers in a birmingham area office which advises the agents in the constituen cies or divisions the agents are dedi cated to maintaining party vigor in the years between elections when an election campaign comes they have complete records of the individual voters then they manage things us ing many volunteers in three constituencies which i visited a con servative candidate defeated a labor member in one case the conserva tive candidate was unimpressive but the agent was excellent the publicopinion polls despite their wide publicity did badly there were so many pollees who answered dont know that the percentages of preferences were meaningless the election proved that the dont knows were really wont tells as the so phistication of voters increases the polling business will meet more and more terrible fiascoes television was in full blast for the first time in this election it ran a poor second to the oldfashioned local meetings with facetoface heckling there were many of what the british call switchoffs macmillan how ever made many votes by his last short personal appeal based upon high

there might be minor inconsistencies due to the image quality and ocr limitations perspective dilemma of the left by raymond moley now seven weeks after witnessing the rout of the labor party in britain and after visiting three other countries in europe it is time to appraise the political revolution which seems to be quietly moving over our western allies it is the ascendency of experience over experimentation the realization of the possible over prophecy things over ideology and fact over fancy we might consider this in our calculations for ireland in turmoil since cromwell is quiet reasonably well to do a bidder for the tourist trade west germany as i noted in an earlier article has its wirtschaftswunder this expression the title of a book on america in by julius hirsch is their word for economic miracle the old socialist party the social democrats has this month renounced marxism as an anachronism italy with considerable poverty still in the south is mostly prosperous and safely governed by the christian democrats most important to us as we approach another election is the plight of the british labor party as lord woolton says in his recently published memoirs the adoption of the name labor party by the socialists was an inspiration but now the name is a millstone because it suggests the idea of a class party and class distinctions are becoming less important over there by the day there are the poor and needy but they are no longer identical with the workers nationalization has no appeal thus the two tenets of socialism the class struggle and government ownership fade into the past leaving hugh gaitskell and his more practical colleagues with a party without an issue an illassorted lot what was significant in the british election was not the third victory of the conservatives but the actual fourth rejection of labor for in the election of a fat majority of in the house of commons was reduced to a little more than a dozen labors great sweep in was a wholly abnormal manifestation of weariness impatience and neardespair by a nation eviscerated by a long war at the forthcoming conference of the labor party there will be underlined the internal malaise with which it is afflicted the creators of the party and its component elements have always been an illassorted lot there were the armchair doctrinaire fabians like shaw economists like the webbs bitter haters of everything traditional like aneurin bevan trade unionists welfare workers amateur university intellectuals and politicians who were refugees from the prostrate liberal party this aggregation was illfitted to provide a major alternative for the business of government in the past the alternative to the tories had been the liberals led by such great parliamentarians as gladstone and asquith these offered differences in emphasis and in direction but a wide similarity of purpose permitted the two parties to alternate in governing britain with no revolutionary changes party or movement within the present parliamentary minority there are men like gaitskell who would like to fulfill a function similar to that of the liberals of the past but the composition and support of the party frustrates this ideal for the party has its share of zealots still intent upon marxist goals moreover it must depend for finances upon the trade unions which are concerned with more immediate practical advantages compromise must be sought at every turnimpossible compromises considering the composition of the party following as someone wrote during the campaign gaitskell is at a loss as to whether he is the head of a responsible party suited to govern or the high priest of a reform movement this is his dilemma unless it can be resolved his party may die surely it can never regain power in its present state during the campaign gaitskell followed a line known to americans through democrats like the humphreys and republicans like the rockefellers and javitses it promises lower taxes and high spending to be paid for out of a hypothetical increase in the rate of production the british refused the gamble americans if they are wise should also reject such economic illusions newsweek november perspective registered us patent office the needs of our schools by raymond moley despite the ballyhoo for federal aid that will surround the forthcoming white house conference on education two serious obstacles stand in its way the first is the fear in the south that federal money would be used to enforce desegregation the other is the rational and factual argument against resorting to federal aid to meet the needs of our schools that rational and factual argument against any federal plan has never been stated better than in a booklet just published by the american enterprise association in washington dc this study invaluable to the citizen lost in the turbulent sea of statistics and semantics is entitled federal aid to educationboon or bane its author is roger a freeman assistant to governor langlie of the state of washington freeman served as chief adviser to the bennion committee of the commission on intergovernmental relations which last spring presented very strong exceptions to plans for federal aid which were before congress at that time some of the pertinent questions on this subject with freemans answers are these is there a denial of schooling for american children and if so how severe is it the national education association a chief proponent of federal aid has claimed that children were not attending school in freeman answers that this figure includes million yearold kindergartners and million who were beyond the compulsory attendance age in their states is there a teacher shortage not as great as in many other important professions and occupations what about salaries between and the pay of educators rose per cent this was higher than the rise of managers proprietors professional and technical workers it was lower than skilled and unskilled industrial workers how big is the need for new school construction the estimates have a bewildering variety running from to schoolrooms it is an obvious fact that slavish adherence to tradition in the observance of hours of use and vacations means that school property is grossly underused can states and local governments afford to meet their own needs in school construction and teachers salaries for the most part yes no state has exhausted its taxing powers and both states and local communities still have vast borrowing capacity could federal aid be provided equitably and rationally no for politics would require some form of acrosstheboard aid in which both the rich and poor would participate no one has yet devised a politically acceptable method of applying federal aid only where there is a genuine need could we have federal aid without federal control dr sm brownell now us commissioner of education said in if federal aid is to bring about better schools it seems apparent that there must be some federal control control by a federal bureau would be bad enough but there would to a degree be control of that bureau by national pressure groups such as the nea my own conclusion after a careful perusal of this freeman study is that while there are spots where there is real need and where local districts and other units are short of resources a clumsy politically inspired system of federal aid would not meet those real needs while it would waste money on places where no need exists what is needed is a nonpolitical independent and scientific determination of needs and resources and the application of money accurately designed to meet only genuine necessities this sort of aid is a job for private philanthropy not the government the ford foundation through its fund for the advancement of education has made a very considerable study of the subject why shouldnt the ford foundation with its resources in billions undertake to go beyond mere surveys and provide the help that is needed the ford money came from the main streets of america why shouldnt a large part of that money be spent there newsweek november perspective common sense and taxes by raymond moley the rush into print by leaders of both parties in congress with assurances of relief to the suffering taxpayer is belated but welcome quite properly these promises are made with the qualification that drastic budget cuts should precede tax cuts there is another qualification which may or may not be observed when and if tax relief comes it should be something more than a mere handout such as a raising of exemptions a tax plan should recognize a number of very important principles it should provide relief all along the line it should be a program of reduction extending over a period of years it should recognize that the evil in present rates is their steep progression it should provide the greatest relief for the middleincome groupsthe real victims of present policies it should recognize that more revenue may well be gained from lower rather than higher rates it should discourage the growth of government particularly federal expenditures it should moderate the tax on individuals and on small businesses and also discourage the unproductive disposition of large incomes now made to escape taxes the new bounty finally and i believe most important it should give the benefit of the anticipated growth of our national production to taxpayers not to specially selected beneficiaries of handouts one of the most pernicious of economic theories which now prevail in washington is that since we may anticipate about billion or billion increases in our national product this new bounty as candidate stevenson called it in his campaign should go for increases in federal expenditures this new economics is more dangerous than that promulgated by the late lord keynes for keynes favored cutting back spending in good times the new bounty economics popular not only among liberal democrats but among economic wizards in the eisenhower administration would continue spending increases in good times because there is more wealth to tax antoni n sadlak has been a hardworking and clearthinking congressman from connecticut for more than ten years out of his experience on the ways and means committee and other sources he has developed a taxreduction plan embodied in hr this bill recognizes the principles listed above it does not cover all inequities but it strikes at the most pernicious which are in the individual and corporate income taxes gradual reduction his plan would contemplate a gradual reduction in rates over a period of five years beginning next january the reductions specified would give to the taxpayers the benefit of the new bounty without reducing the actual revenues of the federal government if the president and congress will keep expenditures down it might be possible under such a plan to pay off a part of the debt the sadlak plan would start with a reduction of per cent a year in the basic per cent rate then the surtaxes above that would be reduced yearly at rates which in five years would bring the total paid by any individual down to per cent corporate taxes would come down from to per cent the bulk of individual relief would be in the basic rate which now provides per cent of the billion raised from individuals the extremely high rates yield relatively little revenue at present people in the brackets above per cent paid in only seven per cent of the total individual income taxes those in the brackets above per cent paid less than two per cent the reduction in corporate rates would in fact enable a price reduction since in reality the corporate tax is an excise paid by the consumer the bill has a builtin safeguard which would permit the president and congress to postpone a scheduled reduction for six months or a year whenever there is danger of a deficit if all possible postponements were used the full reduction would take place in nine rather than five years authority for these reductions however would put the burden of proof on the president and congress there will be other plans for tax relief but sadlak has drawn attention to the substance of the problem newsweek may heres a text extraction of the provided image due to the quality of the image and the

perceptive californians are deeply concerned with what they believe to be the most important lesson to be learned from the recent senatorial election in wisconsin this is the fact there demonstrated that names however splendiferous and presidential sponsorship however fervent cannot avail against the drive of an efficient organization dedicated to getting out the vote that is the sort of thing that gained for a man named proxmire in a byelection nearly the entire normal democratic vote it may well get a lot of victims out here it is the united political machinery of the labor unions in their effort to make their own laws by making their own lawmakers the headlines and political small talk here and in most of the country concern the shining sons of the golden statethe chief justice the vice president the republican leader of the senate and the california governor but while these eminent men have been sweeping this state over and over a far far more important operation has been in actionsomething to reckon with after warren nixon knowland knight even mr eisenhower have vanished from the front pages republican losses here are ominous figures in when mr truman carried california republican candidates for the us house of representatives received per cent of the vote but in when the presidential vote favored the republican candidate the republican share of the house vote dropped to per cent in despite the big eisenhower majority it fell much moreto per cent as it fell three districts switched from republican to democratic in the cio selected the republican congressman in the twelfth district fresno for extermination and succeeded in the aflcios cope committee on political education moved into the eleventh district and by a thoroughly professional job supplanted another republican with a political newcomer this invites a closer look at the trend it shows that in the past four biennial elections hitherto solid republican counties have become marginal and marginal republican counties have become marginal democratic and marginal democratic counties have become solidly democratic this trend has been especially notable in the sparsely settled areas in the north on the eastern border and in the lush san joaquin valley this is evidence of the recent aflcio strategy no doubt created by walter reuther of seeking congressional seats where the attack is least expected and where the most seats can be gained with the least expenditure of money and manpower alliances in such areas are made with publicpower zealots radical farmers and other collectivist groups obvious examples are the oregon sweep and the capture of senate seats in idaho and colorado note also the capture of the twelfth california in and the eleventh in copes harvest the trend is notable in the state legislature in there were in the assembly republicans and democrats in there were republicans and democrats there has been one republican gain in a byelection recently in the senate in there were republicans and democrats in the recent session the senate party count was and governor knight told me recently that two of the republicans were voting with the democrats this drive for the legislature is intended not only as a means of stopping any legislation opposed by the unions but for the more important purpose of controlling the reapportionment of the state after the census of when it is expected that the present us house representation of will climb to or gerrymandering will give aflcio several additional easy districts thus while the curious public is beguiled by the cavorting and the rivalries of bigname figures cope is gathering in the jobs which make the laws in fact there may even be another proxmire in the senate to succeed knowland cope has already captured the democratic party in california and may well turn the state into another michigan newsweek september heres a text extraction of the provided image note that due to the columnar layout and

heat of the summer are not at home to enjoy the change they are there facing another sort of heat explaining their records on the issues which concern their constituents there is always need for that because in their long absences during the sessions of congress there are plenty of enemies and rivals prowling about describing their voting records in most unflattering terms this is never difficult to do for a member of congress must register many votes and by a process of selection and omission he can be made to appear in a most unfavorable light in so far as republican members are concerned this was made more annoying because a private publication the congressional quarterly in its reports had in its choice of roll calls permitted partisans to draw the inference that the presidents support came largely from democrats in the campaign of for instance the cq was widely used to back up such a statement as this by candidate stevenson the truth is that president eisenhower cynically coveted as a candidate but ignored as a leader is largely indebted to democrats in congress for what accomplishments he can claim republican defense in several articles in this space in the summer of i denied this conclusion by citing the full record of roll calls in contradiction to the selectivity of the congressional quarterly subsequently senator schoeppel chairman of the republican campaign committee spread on the record a full account of members voting which substantiated my own apparently the cq revised its method of compiling records but it has again been necessary for the republican campaign chairmen in the senate and house senator schoeppel and representative simpson to offer their own compilation of members records one of their compilations concerns republican support of the president as compared with democratic support the other concerns the relative standing of the membership of the two parties on the vital issue of economy the analyses of voting were published in the congressional record of sept figures in both the house and senate show that when the chips were down on important items of the eisenhower programin roll calls in each housethe republican support score was per cent and democratic support registered per cent however to the average citizen the votes on economy are more important than support or opposition to the president on this point senator schoeppel said in his statement votes on economy the congressional quarterly of aug once again published a misleading report it gives the impression that democratic members of the senate were more concerned with economy than the republicans schoeppel points out that the cq did not include many issues that were of great significance one of these he says was the hells canyon bill on which the democrats voted favorably and republicans opposed in the roll calls which schoeppel cites per cent of the economy votes were by republicans only were by democrats on the house side congressman simpson presented record votes of which reflected a stand on economy of these simpson says republicans cast per cent of the economy votes the democrats cast per cent of all spending votes the schoeppelsimpson researches indicate great care it is a pity however that this vital matter is thus left to rival claims would it not be a wise thing for both parties in congress to set up a bipartisan statistical agency which might make plain and easily understandable the votes of the parties as a whole and of individual members then let the voters decide at the present time not only does the congressional quarterly but the ada the aflcio committee on political education and several other agencies publish confusing versions then the party leaders issue their own reports newsweek october heres a text

committees by raymond moley if any man ever earned a twilight of unworried years it is dwight d eisenhower he has spent himself lavishly for us in war and peace as medical authority now tells us he carried on at the peril of his life after once more a grim warning knocks at his door his dearest friends his near kin and his own intelligence should save him from the greater peril of government through a plural regency in the weeks and months ahead these moral and equitable considerations have priority over the interests and purposes however sincerely held of official associates who believe unbroken tenure of active service indispensable for him as well as for themselves inability or disability both words are used in the constitution does exist medical opinion says just that the coronary thrombosis and the cerebral thrombosis come from the same underlying pathology despite what the white house has said a national emergency also exists the threat of war our shaky alliances the financial necessities of our government the unmistakable hesitation of business stress between north and south and the demoralization of the presidents party should command the utmost energies of a well man vested with untrammeled and undivided responsibility and authority those immediately around the president should not repeat the makeshift course taken in and the vice president now as then is constrained by sensibilities of honor propriety and prudence from speaking his mind concerning what course should be taken indivisible authority common sense must reject the claim that a disabled president can make the decisions while a congeries of committees work out the onerous preliminaries decision cannot be divorced from exploration of facts discussion argument and a clear examination of alternatives these facts together with the presidents past recognition of such a possible emergency call for one of two and only two courses one is resignation and the other is the assumption by the vice president of all not part of what the constitution designates as the powers and duties of the presidency the happiest solution would be for the president himself to make that decision at once in the present absence of legal provision for such transfer of authority the presidents decision would not be questioned then as the president himself has urged from time to time congress should assume its constitutional duty and provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability and also for the determination when the disability be removed it would be absurd to vest by law such determinations in the vice president or the cabinet they are parties of interest the supreme court in marbury vs madison declared that congress may not impose additional original jurisdiction upon the supreme court also there would be grave doubt whether this would be a judicial matter and the court would i believe refuse to act sovereignty in congress between elections the president and congress share the sovereignty of the nation in this case the congress is the nations sovereign power hence congress should make the decisions in each individual case by a majority vote of the house and by twothirds of the senate as in impeachment proceedings two terrifying examples of the neglect of congress to provide for disability confront us the wilson incapacity according to the authoritative prof charles seymour resulted in our failure to enter the league of nations i heard it from democratic senators then on the foreign relations committee that except for the faltering hand of wilson the necessary reservations to the covenant would have been accepted the other example was the clear but unrevealed inability of president roosevelt in and perhaps in the latter case partisanship would have prevented congressional action but the fact was there the safety of the nation internal and external as well as the life and wellbeing of a beloved president depend upon action in this crisis newsweek december heres a text version of the provided image note that perfect accuracy is difficult due to the image quality and column layout some minor variations in phrasing or punctuation might exist perspective a stool needs three legs by raymond moley the homely metaphor of the threelegged stool will serve to describe what the republican party needs to stabilize itself for there are laws in politics as well as in physics which forbid defiance of gravity many people glibly assume that all the gop needs is a new party philosophy and bright new faces on the tickets it is true that the party needs a fighting faith sharply distinguished from that of the socalled liberals and attractive candidates but the party needs basic organization too and since that is the longer job it should be first on the agenda as the national committee meets in des moines in late january a master plan prepared by chairman meade alcorn and reported in the press is to be the subject of discussion at that meeting and rightly it stresses better organization as a major problem this plan is in many respects excellent it stresses the congressional district as the basic unit for work in regaining control of the federal government and also of state legislatures and governorships the congressional district is a manageable unit larger than the county and smaller than the state the plan also suggests annual regional conferences devoted to the training of local people in campaign techniques and strategy the unions know how these fundamentals are understood clearly by many people in the democratic party especially the politically minded leaders of the labor unions twenty years ago these union leaders realized that behind the facade of a very popular president the party units were hollow shells hence those leaders moved in with money manpower and highly skilled political methods of getting out the vote and took over in many districts and states they began at the level of the precinctthe city block the apartment house and the shop their agents were professional in two senses they were paid yearround employees of the unions themselves or in the case of shop stewards of management they were also expertly trained in the downtoearth practice of union politics while there should be more enforcement of the laws regarding the use of union funds their power has amply been demonstrated by the number of political unknowns and greenhorns whom they elected to the th congress the republican party need not adopt their legislative objectives as some liberal republicans suggest but the party might learn from their technique build from bottom up in the republican party however there are two factors which complicate the problem it cannot commandeer the services of workers generally volunteers must constitute the main reliance in campaigns and the republican party is composed of many parts there are the national committee and the two campaign committees in the houses of congress at the top these have no direct authority over the countless local and state republican organizations hence there must be a clear distinction as to the functions of the local and state parties and the national organizations the alcorn program fails it seems to me to emphasize this distinction the republican party can never regain its strength except as it is built from the bottom the national committee may suggest and to a degree help it cannot impose its will upon the states and localities and alcorns suggestion of a group of roving experts to go into states and work is impracticable and dangerous for it may not be realized in washington yet but there is a strong feeling in the states and congressional districts that they must work out their own salvation an earlier suggestion of mine made in this space shortly after the election is essential that is the employment in to congressional districts of paid yearround managers financed by the people in the districts and responsible to the party organizations there the national committee might well set up an institute or school to train these professionals and also give publicity to party principles through pronouncements of the president and vice president so far as recruiting candidates and directing local activities are concerned its function should be purely advisory this is a workable formula for success in newsweek january note the

advocate recognition for to do so would ignite bitter indignation among the american people the moral element i have also explained that our policy of recognition has greatly changed since president woodrow wilson broke precedent in refusing recognition to a mexican dictator and later to soviet russia in earlier years we followed the international custom of recognizing any country which had measurable stability the wilson doctrine brought the moral element into recognition in present american policy are several new elements we are a member of the united nations pledged by its charter against aggression as a national policy a policy persistently followed by the peking government moreover our people bear the bitter memory of thousands of americans killed by chinese intervention in the korean war and we have a profound obligation to formosa which in our obligation to formosa which in our obligation to formosa which in our left japans peril from communism is both external and internal it lies close to the overwhelming powers of red china and soviet russia and has no significant military strength to protect itself they would certainly make trouble for a capitalist japan nor could japan contend with the greatly increased infiltration which would follow recognition internally japan faces great dangers from communism communists since their official party has virtually disappeared have crept into labor unions the socialist party student groups and clubs these elements working through the organizations they have entered have as their prime objective the weakening of japans system of policing and internal security denials needed fourteen years of study and investigation of the administration of criminal justice in the s and s in part for federal and state official agencies have helped me to evaluate closely japans police and internalsecurity system it is far from adequate during the occupation scap required the complete decentralization and reorganization of the efficient system that prevailed before the pacific war this went so far that japans capacity to maintain order was drastically weakened only the presence of american military power assured security since the occupation national legislation has improved things but much more needs to be done especially to secure the national government in the capital area of tokyo a capital is the danger point for revolutions it is evident that peking invests a lot of money in japans political campaigns an election of tokyos governor or mayor is to be held this month and half of the upper house of the diet in june the campaigns are already under way most important is the need to resolve all doubt about any plans for recognizing red china this is up to the responsible officials of both parties in

the moderator whether i was worried about the number of businessmen whom eisenhower had chosen for his official family i an swered that i was not nearly so wor ried as i would be if i were one of the businessmen concerned for to these men is now offered a challenge which if successfully met will deliver the business community from its long exclusion from official life and the public suspicion which was placed upon it by attacks of the roosevelt and truman administrations and now as the tumult and the shouting of the in auguration dies and the captains and the kings of the fair deal depart and the new administrators settle down at their desks this awesome question rises on every side how is this administration going to fulfill the hopes of those millions who put them there and withdraw from its twenty years role of planner manager and provider and assume its proper place in a free society a very helpful contribution to an answer to this question comes to me in a letter from a friend who is a notable businessman in his own right he is courtney brown an official of the standard oil co of new jersey and a director of esso his letter in part follows it has been said there is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has not come the attitudes and the affairs of men move in broad tidal patterns it may not be pressing the point too far to say there has been an accumu lating body of evidence in recent years that the tide is beginning to swing from what might be called stat ism that is not only true in this coun try i think it would have been true even if stevenson had been elected but to a lesser extent but it is also true in elections and events in other parts of the free world the important thing it seems to me is that the ad ministration think its way through to where the new drift is leading us and attempt to rationalize and direct the movement into the most benefi cial patterns it would be a mistake to interpret this movement away from statism as a movement to or even toward the al ternative of oldfashioned individual ism the world is too complex to entertain the idea that individualism is enough rather i suspect that the new movement is toward increasing reliance upon voluntary associations careful thought at the community level as well as at the state national and even international levels will dis close numerous opportunities for voluntary groups to meet social needsneeds which otherwise will be met by government whether the voluntary organization takes the form of a business firm a labor union a co operative a church a re search or trade organization a university or an entirely new organization to perform a specific function it has one characteristic which differs fundamentally from government it must rely on co operation tolerance understanding and public acceptance for its effectiveness and support whereas government ultimately relies upon various forms of compulsion including taxes if indeed this is the direction in which we are moving there is a real opportunity it seems to me for the new administration to give positive encouragement and direction it may be that only by doing so can the administration find the means of making good on its implicit commitment to curtail the responsibility of government and the size of the federal establishment we cannot escape from the present tangle of bureaucracy and deficits merely by dropping functions now performed by the government merely to scuttle and run will bring public indignation political retaliation and ultimate reaction to statism there has been a lot of talk in the air about government reorganization of late perhaps these discussions should include consideration of the advisability of setting up in the bureau of the budget a small group of highly qualified widely acquainted men and women whose sole function would be to study promote and facilitate in all appropriate ways the assumption of social functions by voluntary

washington lobby for rural electrification many members of congress and zealots for a government power monopoly want to push rural electrification beyond the remote farmers who are now supplied to the suburbs and the cities this would be deadly competition with investorowned companies because the government is lending money to the rural electrical cooperatives at per centhalf or less what the government must pay for it spectacular growth no one questions the validity of the original purpose of the rea nor the wholesome character of most of the cooperatives most of them are content with sticking to their field with modest returns but since they are associated in a sort of trade associationpressure lobby called the national rural electric cooperative association they are being led collectively into a vast scheme which promises illimitable profits not in the production and sale of electricity but in banking and investment that is so long as the present per cent rate of borrowing from the government and taxfree status can be retained the head of the nreca clyde c ellis is a man of vast imagination coupled with incredible political influence at the last meeting of his

million in it was million the total earned surplus rose from million in to million in ellis proposed that the investment account be put into his nreca in trusteeshipan unusual function for a trade associationpressure organization then he proposed that this pool be placed with a new york bank for investment opportunities it is ironical that ellis has always denounced the wall street financing of the private investorowned companies bluechip pool a pool he said would be able to invest a reasonable portion of its funds quite soundly in the highest grade blue chip industrial bonds and most of the balance in the highestyield longterm governments the pool would have a constant inflow from maturing investments and from new investments and therefore would have to keep on hand only a relatively small amount of shortterm lowyield governments this fact alone could appreciably increase the return over that of a single systems program with the same flexibility it would indeed if the cooperatives choose to relinquish their independence and give over to this sort of vast investment operation made profitable by borrowing from the government at half or less than half the price which government must pay for its money for this pool might become the biggest thing in wall street space permits only a mention of another ellis dream recently proposed it would have the federal government build a

in the quiet of the green mountains there is time to reflect upon the brief chroni cles of the times a few observations emerge concerning a current trend in politics and education i feel no pessi mism about the fiber of our people but our leaders are cause for alarm a century ago the bright brave faith in democracy was in popular elections and the elevation of the common man to uncommon responsi bilities our system it was believed would produce superleaders that was not the faith of the sober gentle men who founded the republic nor was it shared by acute foreign ob servers like toqueville the tide of popularization swept on after the civil war tossing into power mediocrities demagogues and ras cals later in the s the theme was that the remedy for the evils of democracy is more democracy the choosing of candidates was vested in primaries and the people assumed the immensely complex task of mak ing the laws through popular vote still democracy didnt democ the irrational end is here first there is the current obsession with polls which captures many journalists and politicians leaders who were given their audiences in the belief that they had something to lead with while governor rockefeller has de nied a report that he is going to per mit the polls to determine his decision to compete for the presidency this report widely published indicated the weight attached to these auguries and was a shock to many thoughtful people this was the comment of a great reporter arthur krock who has never followed the pack the passion for polls under such circumstances a presi dential candidate would be the product of questions selected and phrased by a small group and asked of a tiny percentage of the popula tion in periods prior to those which might bring fundamentally different responses such pitifully small sam ples are organized as a profitmaking business some of them financed by presidential aspirants who have or can raise the money to do so krock further suggests that the next presi dent will be spawned out of a row of clacking computer machines disaster befell thomas e dewey in because his great confidence in polls shaped his carefree itsin thebag campaign but at the moment nothing so occupies the at tention of several putative presiden tial candidates as polls other examples of feedback are in congress in a senate where once was heard the profound

newsweek august perspective mr k farm expert by raymond moley it must not be forgotten that khrushchev rose to power as a sort of agricultural genius not even the mystical henry wallace has had such wonderful farm plans as the jolly slav but unlike our henry mr k had di rect methods of demonstrating his talents henry had statistics at his command and some authority but he was always hampered by his naïve ideas which he designated as demo cratic mr k permitted no such im pediments furthermore he created his own statistical successes he originated in a ukrainian vil lage and has posed as an agrarian expert a man close to the people who toil on collective farms it was mr k who a few years ago opened vast tracts east of the urals for progressive agriculture it was a foolhardy venture and there was plenty of headshaking among the hardhanded practical people who knew well the hostile arid wastes of kazakhstan but a plans a plan in the soviet regardless of the lord na ture and experience and so men tractors and then women were shipped into the semidesert while henry wallace was a deeply religious man with mystical overtones and mr k certainly is not apparently the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike this time heavily in favor of the latter the rain came a mild tem perature prevailed and the stuff grew mr k was photographed smil ing over a large potato soviet juggling act statistics dont lie they say but it depends upon what you are counting and when facts can be manipulated to suit a purpose in mr ks rise after stalins death he made a sen sational announcement soviet rus sia has fewer cattle than there were in czarist russia specialists pon dered this astonishing assertion they found that mr k had classified cows as pigs and statistically transformed horned cattle into mares thus at the beginning of his enterprise he could point with alarm after three years statistical pigs were reincarnated as cows and the mares resumed their bovine classification the khrushchev propaganda duly capitalized upon this miracle wallace had a host of statisticians and knew in his off hours various haruspices if he had suc ceeded as he is doing now with chickens in cross breeding the two species his farm plans might have been the wonder of the ages that miracle belongs to the atheist mr k americans are familiar with the so viet boast whatever you do we can do better an american army officer in tokyo whose thumb was double jointed illustrated to a russian officer how he could bend his thumb back to his forearm the russian did it and was immediately consigned to the tokyo hospital readers of war and peace will remember the officer who consumed a bottle of vodka while standing on a window ledge behavior pattern this russian trait will be apparent in mr ks

this evidence of an american achievement they resumed their wecandoitbetter one of them asked the meaning of coor on the truck a representative of the state department explained one of the soviet

visiting three other countries in europe it is time to appraise the political revolution which seems to be quietly moving over our western allies it is the ascendency of experience over experimentation the realization of the possible over prophecy things over ideology and fact over fancy we might consider this in our calculations for ireland in turmoil since cromwell is quiet reasonably well to do a bidder for the tourist trade west germany as i noted in an earlier article has its wirtschaftswunder this expression the title of a book on america in by julius hirsch is their word for economic miracle the old socialist party the social democrats has this month renounced marxism as an anachronism italy with considerable poverty still in the south is mostly prosperous and safely governed by the christian democrats most important to us as we approach another election is the plight of the british labor party as lord woolton says in his recently published memoirs the adoption of the name labor party by the socialists was an inspiration but now the name is a millstone because it suggests the idea of a class party and class distinctions are becoming less important over there by the day there are the poor and needy but they are no longer identical with the workers nationalization has no appeal thus the two tenets of socialism the class struggle and government ownership fade into the past leaving hugh gaitskell and his more practical colleagues with a party without an issue an illassorted lot what was significant in the british election was not the third victory of the conservatives but the actual fourth rejection of labor for in the election of a fat majority of in the house of commons was reduced to a little more than a dozen labors great sweep in was a wholly abnormal manifestation of weariness impatience and neardespair by a nation eviscerated by a long war at the forthcoming conference of the labor party there will be underlined the internal malaise with which it is afflicted the creators of the party and its component elements have always been an illassorted lot there were the armchair doctrinaire fabians like shaw economists like the webbs bitter haters of everything traditional like aneurin bevan trade unionists welfare workers amateur university intellectuals and politicians who were refugees from the prostrate liberal party this aggregation was illfitted to provide a major alternative for the business of government in the past the alternative to the tories had been the liberals led by such great parliamentarians as gladstone and asquith these offered differences in emphasis and in direction but a wide similarity of purpose permitted the two parties to alternate in governing britain with no revolutionary changes party or movement within the present parliamentary minority there are men like gaitskell who would like to fulfill a function similar to that of the liberals of the past but the composition and support of the party frustrates this ideal for the party has its share of zealots still intent upon marxist goals moreover it must depend for finances upon the trade unions which are concerned with more immediate practical advantages compromise must be sought at every turnimpossible compromises considering the composition of the party following as someone wrote during the campaign gaitskell is at a loss as to whether he is the head of a responsible party suited to govern or the high priest of a reform movement this is his dilemma unless it can be resolved his party may die surely it can never regain power in its present state during the campaign gaitskell followed a line known to americans through democrats like the humphreys and republicans like the rockefellers and javitses it promises lower taxes and high spending to be paid for out of a hypothetical increase in the rate of production the british refused the gamble americans if they are wise should also reject such economic illusions newsweek november heres the text extracted from the provided image note that some minor formatting inconsistencies might remain due to the image quality and the nature of ocr

beginnings of the past five decades the december days of were shadowed by a turn in personal fortunes doctors said i could survive another summer only by abandoning job plans and prospects in another climate and so from a situation of utter detachment i saw the defeat of an old order which began in march with the clipping of the wings of speaker joe cannon by a revolt of progressives in the house in november the republican party encumbered by a reactionary money power met defeat young idealists were inspired by the hope of a decade of domestic reform this expectation of a brave new order was blighted by war in then just before world war ii the prospect of stabilizing reform and the denial of a third term was promising but the imminence of war assured another roosevelt term thus all calculations for the s must be limited by the possibility of war or its imminence war is the master of political destinies peril of predictions in the early spring of i sat with two of ohios top republicans on a train from columbus to cleveland one had spent some days in washington with a carefree warren harding and the senators cronies highballs penny ante and golf the other leader said with a sneer that harding would be nothing but a favorite son and a pawn in convention strategy governor lowden will be nominated he concluded no one mentioned the inconspicuous governor of massachusetts lesson ii avoid predictions about nominees in it was clear that an economic earthquake would bring about a revival of the progressivism of twenty years before that is what happened in it was apparent that only the flabby campaigning of candidate dewey had prevented a defeat for government by cronyism and for blunders in dealing with communism at home and abroad the forces that will shape politics in the s might be war and its threat the economic cycle official corruption personalitiesespecially when they split a partythe movement of population industrial change and invention and the quality of organization barring war and international tensions certain domestic issues will carry far into the s the farm surplus headache will remain with us but its political influence will decline with the accelerating drop in the number of farmers even in the old farm states urban suburban and nonagricultural areas will become predominant trends in it is quite possible to expect that the drift toward federal centralization will be slower the crazy federal socialsecurity and welfare setup in the face of the certain event of its bankruptcy will be rationalized wage earners will continue to be strongly unionized but automation foreign competition and shifting public tastes for products will mean critical years for labor leadership as wage earners move farther into the middleincome group the influence of a purely political labor power will decline there will still be the poor and needy but workers will no longer be proletarians the fiscal obligations of the federal government because of present and prospective federal programs will reach a trillion dollars in the s presently tapped tax sources cannot sustain that load the rate of growth of national wealth and income relied upon by some to meet these huge obligations is speculative it will not suffice the credit of the united states must be a major domestic concern of the presidency the party system is now in decline perhaps a new pattern of modified competitive capitalism will be embraced by both parties shorn of the outworn shibboleths of the s and s both parties can operate to provide effective options for choice by the

men who run the parties the city of bristol lives in the history of politics in its mercantile group decided to defeat edmund burke its representative in parliament it is not especially relevant to note that on the issues which created their oppositionnamely the american colonies and irelandburke was proved to be magnificently correct more relevant it is that in a speech he made before the election he said that while the member owed much to his constituents he must put the national interest over their selfish interests and that only through strong national parties could freedom be sustained these two principles are definitely established in british politics the member and the candidate look to the high command of the party rather than to their constituents for guidance on policy with these points in mind i have sought on this visit to study the party in the constituencies in my article last week i noted my observations concerning the prime ministers home constituency of warwick leamington and kenilworth the big regional conservative office in birmingham and the conservative fight to win the marginal seat at rugby next i journeyed to the constituency of chippenham which stretches miles from east to west and contains two or three fairsize towns and a most attractive countryside electoral lubricant the conservative agent there is brig ja mellsop who retired from the regular army after twenty years service he is responsible not strictly to the member from chippenham but to the head office of the party in london during the campaign he has five or six paid employees but most of his department heads and a great many workers are volunteers everything is governed by written orders from mellsop his area of operation comprises voting districts and he must create and energize a committee with a chairman and volunteer workers in each these distribute and mail party literature but their most important task is the canvass the basic element in an election campaign workers carry with them lists of the qualified voters and after an interview register thereon the preference of the voter early in the campaign those who will need to vote by mail are identified if they are conservative it is the job of the agent to see that they file the necessary paper for a ballot on election day the mellsop organization must see to it that every conservative in the constituency votes mellsop must also schedule six or eight daily appearances of his candidate at designated spots and an equal number for the candidates wife the chippenham member is sir david eccles minister of education the brigadier only has to spend in the campaign in bristol i confined my attention to the labor party the secretary of the borough labor party is wj waring who presides over six constituencies four of which are safely labor he is secretary of the bristol trade union council he is also an elected member of the borough council miserable wages compared with the average conservative constituency headquarters labor suffers from stark poverty their offices are usually in dingy inexpensive quarters their employees are few and poorly paid at least per cent of the money necessary to run the labor party comes from the unions the sums collected from union members are miserably small and the difficulty of recruiting party members outside the unions is shown by the fact that while votes were cast here in for labor candidates there are only additional party members a constituency agent whose operation i witnessed gets only a week he is a skilled engineer and could if he left his party work earn twice that waring himself newsweek heres a text version of the provided image note that due to the image quality and twocolumn layout some minor inaccuracies may be present perspective registered us patent office lessons for americans by raymond moley londonthe monumental sweep of the conservatives in the british general election offers many forceful lessons for american political parties for our politically active labor unions and for americans generally the plain facts revealed can scarcely be argued americans should abandon many of their political phantoms and fallacies the liberal wing of the democratic party should note the great similarity between its arguments and the now discredited appeals of the british socialists both promise greater spending for social services housing and educational novelties both would find new taxes from the rich and from business both offer the keynesian theory of multiplying production by government spending in this gaitskell and most american liberal politicians and economists offer the same false elixir the british socialists and american liberals are simply offering the antiquated concepts of the s the british electorate weary of these ideas rejected them and their sponsors local organization the political labor unions in america and the british socialists alike encourage a class divisionthe rich and big business against the poor this class appeal utterly failed in this election the great and growing middle group who are a majority in both countries want no class struggle both british and american workers are coming to scorn the idea that they are a class apart republicans and conservative democrats should stop trying to outpromise liberal democrats this only produces apathy which keeps their potential voters at home on election day we should have learned that in the british conservatives waste no time trying to argue with committed socialists they get their own potential voters to vote the conservatives fought hard and hit hard a soft appeal tranquilizes there must be a definable choice hard hitting produces excitement and a big vote and it was proved here that a big vote is a solidly conservative not a radical vote most important is the need of republicans and conservative democrats for strong active local organization in britain much of the power that has brought victory in three elections and a great gain in four has come from the efficient party organization built up by lord woolton and churchill more than ten years ago after a great defeat its high efficiency has been kept up since it is based on the fact that elections are won in many local areas not on a mythical national level the big factor in conservative organization is the agent who is professionally trained over a period of a year or eighteen months and who works the year around work of agents realizing the importance of the local areas from my experience in covering the elections of and i neglected london this time and spent the last week in the birmingham area which comprises constituencies the party machinery centers in a birmingham area office which advises the agents in the constituencies or divisions the agents are dedicated to maintaining party vigor in the years between elections when an election campaign comes they have complete records of the individual voters then they manage things using many volunteers in three constituencies which i visited a conservative candidate defeated a labor member in one case the conservative candidate was unimpressive but the agent was excellent the publicopinion polls despite their wide publicity did badly there were so many pollees who answered dont know that the percentages of preferences were meaningless the election proved that the dont knows were really wont tells as the sophistication of voters increases the polling business will meet more and more terrible fiascoes television was in full blast for the first time in
